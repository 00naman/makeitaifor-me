# My Dummy Blog Post

This is a sample blog post created using MDX. MDX allows you to write using the Markdown syntax while also enabling you to import and use React components.

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example using React and MDX:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const HelloWorld = () => {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default HelloWorld;
```
